# HPSTR Pelican Theme

This is an copy and port to [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) static site generator of the [HPSTR Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/hpstr-jekyll-theme)
All credits for that beautiful theme go to [Michael Rose](https://github.com/mmistakes)


## What HPSTR brings to the table:

* Responsive templates for post, page, and post index. Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
* Graceful degradation in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.
* Modern and minimal design.
* Sweet animated menu.
* Readable typography to make your words shine.
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Social Sharing links for Facebook, Twitter, and Google+, if you choose.
* Open Graph metadata for SEO and better embeds in social networks.
* Google Web fonts.

## Supported plugins

Pelican comes with additional plugins that you can install and activate for your website. For more information see the [pelican-plugins](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins) repository.

Here are the plugins that should work out of the box with that theme if enabled:

* [related posts](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/related_posts)

    Displays related articles at the bottom of a blog post being read.

* [i18n subsites](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/i18n_subsites)

    Extends the translations functionality by creating internationalized sub-sites for the default site. Also takes care of translating theme items.
